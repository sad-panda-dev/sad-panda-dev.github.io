            <h3 style="text-align:center;">What A Long Strange Trip It's Been...</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">I've spent over a decade and a half of my professional career working as a chef in the midcoast Maine area.  
                A few years ago, while trekking in the Himalayas, I came to the realization that this was not a career path that I wished to pursue in the long term. 
                This realization was unsettling at first. I had spent so many hours studying, reading, researching, 
                and learning about any aspect of cooking or what it takes to manage and run a professional kitchen. 
                To then find out that I donâ€™t feel I can continue down this road anymore left me with a lot of questions.  
                What do I want to do instead of cooking? Will any of the skills that I have come to acquire over the years be relevant 
                in my new field of concentration, or will I be starting completely from scratch. Should I go back to school?</p>

        <div style="position: relative;">
            <div style="color: #777;background-color:white;text-align:center;padding:50px 80px;text-align: justify;">
              <p style="font-size: 20px;">I have always been interested in computers and the capabilities that they have. So I thought that perhaps a career in 
                computer science would be something that I find interesting. I then started to do a deep dive into what field of computer science 
                I would like to pursue. I was almost immediately drawn to software development. The idea that there is an underlying set of rules 
                as to how you can and should create software, but there is still room for creativity with regards to how the developer goes about 
                solving the problem, seemed very similar to the aspects of cooking that first drew me to it. I started by learning more about the 
                python programming language, and began to develop very basic rudimentary programs. But I was hooked, and it wasn't long after that 
                I made the decision to go back to school and pursue a degree in computer science. The more I learn about the demands of the job of software development,
                 the more I realize that my years of experience in professional kitchens are going to be very useful. Timing is everything, and 
                 while it is important to work well as an individual at times, it is imperative to be able to be a productive team member. 
                 I was constantly learning new techniques for different dishes I wished to create or recreate, software development will require 
                 that same tenacious nature of always looking for the newest advancements and learning how to implement them. It will allow me to 
                 keep my work as a source of my creativity, and therefore allow me to be more passionate about what I do for work.

                <p style="font-size: 20px;">I'm currently in my third year of university and I have learned so much in such a short time. I am looking forward to what new 
                    concepts and techniques I will be able to learn while working for your company.</p>
